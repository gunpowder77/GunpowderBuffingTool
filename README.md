# GunpowderBuffingTool
A tool for Hardspace: Shipbreaker which allows for the buffing of tools.

To install, you will need BepInEx. Then just drag the folder GunpowderBuffingTool into BepInEx/plugins

After running the game with the plugin for the first time, a config file will be created in BepInEx/config which allows you to turn the plugin off.

Note: This plugin will not allow you to cheat in R.A.C.E. mode, and do not ask me to make it.
